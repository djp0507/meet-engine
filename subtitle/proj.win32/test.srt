11
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,910
The day I went missing...

12
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,910
was the day I died.

13
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,170
Five years in hell forged me into a weapon,

14
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,890
which I use to honor a vow I made to my father,

16
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,310
who sacrificed his life for mine.

17
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,600
In his final moments, he told me the truth...

18
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,810
that our family's wealth

19
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,720
had been built on the suffering of others.

20
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,340
That he failed our city,

21
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,440
and that it was up to me to save it and right his wrongs.

22
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,070
But to do that without endangering the people closest to me,

23
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,100
I have to be someone else.

24
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,570
I have to be something else.

25
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,840
Who's that? Where'd he come from?

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,570
What's going on here?

27
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,250
Get the chopper back now.

28
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,090
Who's this guy?

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,830
Whoa, whoa! Easy, wait, wait!

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,350
- No, please... - Marcus Redman,

31
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,610
you failed this city.

32
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,520
Please, don't! Please! Don't!

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,020
Cell phone, inside pocket, call your partner.

34
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,560
Tell him to give those pensioners back their money.

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,060
Do it now.

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,970
Okay.

37
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,230
Mr. Redman has withdrawn

38
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,180
more than $30 million from the Plan's account.

39
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,620
Mr. Redman claims refunding the Halcyon Pension Plan

40
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,240
has always been his intent.

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,570
But sources say Redman was coerced by the vigilante.

43
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,780
This guy gets more air-time than the Kardashians, right?

44
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,650
Five years on an island and you still know who they are.

45
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,720
I've been catching up.

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,620
It's nice to see how much

47
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,670
our culture has improved while I was away.

48
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,430
But the city used to be different. People used to feel safe.

49
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,620
Aw, what's the matter, Mom? Afraid we're gonna be next?

50
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,580
Do you have any questions about today, Oliver?

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,950
It's a simple proof-of-life declaration.

52
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,050
Just read out a brief, prepared statement to the judge,

53
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,830
and then your death-in-absentia judgment will be voided.

54
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,080
It's fine, Walter, I've been in a courtroom before.

55
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,310
Four times by my estimate.

56
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,390
You know, there was the DUI,

57
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,710
the assault on that paparazzi douchebag,

58
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,130
stealing that taxi, which was just awesome, by the way,

59
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,000
and who could forget peeing on the cop?

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,530
I wish everyone would.

61
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,310
I'd hang, but we're headed to court.

62
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,390
I know, that's why I'm here.

63
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,480
My best friend is getting legally resurrected,

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,180
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

65
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,520
What about you?

66
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,330
Oh, I think the first four times

67
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,520
of you in court was enough for me.

68
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,200
Fair enough.

69
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,750
Mrs. Queen? Car's ready.

70
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,320
Walter.

71
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,670
Are you going to testify as to what happened when the yacht sank?

72
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,230
Are you going to talk about the boat crash?

73
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,040
Mr. Queen, did you see Sarah Lance die?

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,910
Sarah!

75
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,160
There was a storm.

76
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,870
The boat went down. I was the only survivor.

77
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,340
- She's not there! - Sarah!

78
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,570
My father didn't make it.

79
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,160
No!

80
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,630
I almost died, I...

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,170
I thought that I had, because I spent so many days

82
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,450
on that life raft before I saw land.

83
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,950
When I reached it, I knew...

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,110
I knew that I was gonna have to live for both of us.

85
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,840
And in those five years,

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,430
it was that one thought

87
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,280
that kept me going.

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,920
Your Honor, we move to vitiate the death-in-absentia

89
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,860
filed after Oliver's disappearance at sea

90
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,170
aboard the Queen's Gamut five years ago.

91
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,800
Unfortunately we will not be requesting

92
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,400
that the declaration of death filed for the petitioner's father,

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,440
Robert Queen, be rescinded.

94
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,950
The Queen family is only entitled to one miracle, I'm afraid.

95
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,060
Now, onto the offices. Everyone is waiting to meet you there.

96
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,350
Uh, Mom, that was...

97
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,700
a little bit heavier than I was expecting it to be.

98
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,500
Can we do that tomorrow? Please?

99
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,820
- Of course. - Thank you.

100
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,310
Last week, you couldn't wait to get to the company.

101
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,620
Tommy, I'd just spent five years away from civilization.

102
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,180
I wasn't exactly thinking straight.

103
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,160
What are you doing here?

104
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,070
Oh, they were bringing me back from the dead.

105
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,820
Legally speaking.

106
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,880
- What are you doing here? - My job.

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,780
Right. More like the D.A.'s.

108
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,180
- Hi, Oliver Queen. - Emily Nocenti.

109
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Oliver just got back from five years on an uncharted island.

110
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,540
Before that, he was cheating on me with my sister.

111
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,980
He was with her when she died.

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,840
And last week, he told me to stay away from him.

113
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,430
It was really good advice.

114
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,050
Excuse me.

115
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,300
- It was nice to meet you. - Yeah. Let's go.

116
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,180
Come on, buddy, shake it off. Let's go.

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,910
Mr. Somers! Mr. Somers!

118
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,820
about the accusations made by Laurel Lance?

119
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,070
I don't know what I've done to earn this witch-hunt

120
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,080
from Miss Lance and her bosses at the CNRI.

121
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,410
But I can tell you this.

122
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,060
I am an honest businessman,

123
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,580
and I will fight this slander to my last dime and breath.

124
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,740
That's all I have to say, thank you.

125
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,090
Oh, there's Mr. Queen...

126
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,620
Mr. Queen, what happened in there, sir?

127
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,820
Tell us what happened inside, Mr. Queen...

128
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,540
Step back everybody, please.

129
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,850
Can you give us a couple comments about the island, Mr. Queen?

130
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,040
Before you go, sir, please.

131
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,070
Couple of comments about the island, sir. What happened in there?

132
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,470
Everybody, step back.

133
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,990
I'll make you swallow that Nikon. Back!

134
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,410
This happens to you a lot, doesn't it?

135
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,880
How much is a life worth?

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,590
A life of a man, a good man,

137
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,150
a stevedore on the docks of the city in which we live.

138
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,320
A father.

139
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,880
A man with a daughter.

140
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,490
The plaintiff will prove by a preponderance of evidence

141
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,720
that Victor Nocenti learned that his boss,

142
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,080
that man sitting right there, Martin Somers,

143
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,390
was taking bribes from the Chinese Triads

144
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,490
to smuggle drugs into our city.

145
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,260
And when Victor Nocenti threatened to tell the police,

146
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,770
Martin Somers had him killed.

147
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,700
Mr. Somers is very well-connected,

148
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,750
and has friends in the District Attorney's office,

149
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,600
which is why, if Emily Nocenti

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,610
is to get justice for her father's death,

151
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,170
if Martin Somers is to get justice for his crimes,

152
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,000
then someone is going to have to do it for them.

153
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,930
Martin Somers.

154
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,530
Laurel's targeted the worst of Starling City,

155
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,170
so it's no surprise his name is on my father's list.

156
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,340
The city's police and the D.A. can't stop him...

157
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,910
or won't.

158
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,950
Laurel thinks she's the only one willing to bring him to justice.

159
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,770
She's wrong.

160
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,880
You, listen up.

161
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,710
The longer this goes on,

162
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,670
the more likely the media is gonna crucify me.

163
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,860
You shut this trial down, do you understand me?

164
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,550
Yes, sir.

165
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,230
What the hell?

166
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,520
- Martin Somers... - Who the hell are you?

167
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,910
You've failed this city.

168
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,190
No! No, no, no, no, no!

169
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,050
You're gonna testify in that trial.

170
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,730
You're gonna confess to having Victor Nocenti killed.

171
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,670
There won't be a second warning.

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,130
I hired you to protect my son.

173
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,930
Now, I'm not a professional bodyguard,

174
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,940
but it seems to me that the

175
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,920
first requirement would be managing to stay

176
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,460
next to the man you're hired to protect.

177
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,320
With all due respect, ma'am,

178
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,420
I never had a client who didn't want my protection.

179
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,710
I hired you. That makes me the client.

180
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,790
Now where do you think my son

181
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,270
is going on these chaperone-less excursions?

182
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,180
Ma'am, I truly do not know.

183
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,300
And he truly doesn't.

184
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,150
Then perhaps you'd like to share with me

185
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,510
you know, where it is you run off to.

186
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,850
I've been alone for five years.

187
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,190
-I know that, Oliver. -Mom...

188
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,550
Alone.

189
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
I see.

190
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,910
I promise to introduce her if it ever gets

191
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,480
to the exchanging first names stage...

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,080
No, I'd rather you promise to take

193
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,790
Mr. Diggle with you on your next rendezvous.

194
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,990
It's not safe, you've already been abducted once.

195
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,470
There is a maniac out there, hunting the wealthy.

196
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,580
That maniac saved my life.

197
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,690
This isn't a game.

198
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,960
I lost you once.

199
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,580
And I am not going through that again.

200
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,880
Okay.

201
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,580
Digg's my guy.

202
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,280
Thank you.

203
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,630
Sorry to give you so much grief.

204
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,820
I served three tours in Afghanistan, Mr. Queen.

205
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,720
You don't even come close to my definition of grief.

206
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,580
But I tell you what...

207
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,830
you ditch me one more time,

208
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,870
no one will have to fire me.

209
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,800
Where're you going?

210
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,600
Uh... somewhere loud and smoky.

211
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,070
And don't bother trying to pickpocket my stash this time,

212
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,510
because I'm gonna go get drunk instead.

213
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,520
Thea,

214
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,880
do you think this is what dad would want for you?

215
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,290
Dead people don't want anything.

216
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,110
It's one of the benefits of being dead.

217
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,730
I was dead.

218
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,310
And I wanted a lot.

219
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,430
Except for your family.

220
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,990
You've been home a week and all you do

221
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,700
is avoid Mom, ignore Walter, and judge me.

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,670
Don't wait up.

223
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,340
Well, I owe you an apology, Mr. Somers.

224
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,900
We come all the way down to your docks,

225
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,560
and it turns out, you don't need the police after all.

226
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,370
Which is exactly what I've been saying.

227
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,390
Yeah. So I guess that 9-1-1 call we got last night

228
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,360
from your stevedore, saying that you were getting attacked

229
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,440
by a guy in a green hood and a bow and arrow...

230
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,190
I guess... Well,

231
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,660
was that a practical joke?

232
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,810
These guys like to fool around.

233
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,480
Well, you know, I'd be very much inclined

234
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,720
to believe an honest, upstanding businessman like yourself,

235
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,670
except, well, one of my men

236
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,390
found this at your docks.

237
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,650
You see, there's this vigilante running around.

238
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,680
He thinks he's some kind of Robin Hood.

239
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,850
He's robbing the rich,

240
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,940
he's trying to teach them a lesson I guess.

241
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,410
I don't know, I don't know. But the point is,

242
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,780
the man's a killer.

243
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,950
And nothing, and no one,

244
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,730
is going to stop me from bringing him down.

245
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,550
But like you said...

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,620
...clearly, nothing happened here last night.

247
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,480
Isn't this a conflict of interest, detective?

248
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,890
After all, your daughter is suing me.

249
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,770
I'm pretty good at keeping my emotions in check.

250
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,330
I'm not.

251
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,890
You and your daughter don't want to find out what I'm capable of

252
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,260
when I get emotional.

253
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,710
As you can see, Oliver, we've modernized quite a bit.

254
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,500
- Are you enjoying yourself? - Yes, I am.

255
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,890
I remember when your father

256
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,790
used to bring you here when you were a boy.

257
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,620
You always were so excited.

258
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,200
Dad let me drink soda in the office.

259
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,920
Ah! So that's why you enjoyed coming.

260
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,440
The Queen Consolidated's success of late

261
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,620
is a result of its targeted diversification.

262
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,960
We have been making impressive inroads in cutting-edge fields

263
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,480
like bio-tech and clean energy.

264
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
That's neat. Excuse me?

265
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,860
Can I get a sparkling water, or something cold, please?

266
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,600
Sweetheart, Oliver,

267
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,300
Walter and I have something to discuss with you.

268
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,540
Come, please sit.

269
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,590
Mom, it makes me nervous when you ask me to sit down.

270
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,420
The company's about to break ground on a new site

271
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,090
for the Applied Sciences division,

272
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,370
and we would like to honor your father

273
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,710
- by dedicating the building in his name. - Nice.

274
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,090
And we'd like to make an announcement at the dedication

275
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,260
that you will be taking a leadership position in the company.

276
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,620
- No. - No, your... your company.

277
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,570
No, I don't want to lead anything.

278
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,610
Besides, Walter is doing a very good job here.

279
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,730
You said that you wanted to be a different person.

280
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,350
And you are Robert Queen's son.

281
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,660
I don't need to be reminded of that.

282
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,810
Well, obviously you do.

283
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,370
Everyone here understands

284
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,700
that this transition is really difficult for you.

285
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,400
Thank you, Walter.

286
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,710
Which part, though?

287
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,870
Everyone fantasizing that I got my MBA while I was on the island?

288
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,020
Or the fact that my father's CFO

289
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,750
now sleeps down the hall from me?

290
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,970
You know, five years ago,

291
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,570
your irresponsibility was somewhat charming.

292
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,200
It is a lot less so now.

293
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,250
There he is!

294
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,900
The driver will be here in a minute.

295
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,600
Okay.

296
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,970
You know, I spent the first 27 years of my life in Starling City,

297
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,270
and the next five in Afghanistan.

298
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,990
You want to know what I learned?

299
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,070
There's no place like home?

300
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,880
No, just the opposite.

301
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,660
Home is a battlefield.

302
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,200
Back home, they're all trying to get you.

303
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,610
Get you to open up, be somebody you're not sure you are anymore.

304
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,200
Or I could be wrong.

305
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
Maybe after five years alone,

306
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,230
you're not as messed up

307
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,500
in the head as you have every right to be.

308
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,300
Hey!

309
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,630
Hey, get away!

310
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,760
Hey!

311
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,080
Dad?

312
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,270
Hey! Hey, stay away from him!

313
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,110
Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney

314
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,830
will try and paint you as

315
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,400
blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.

316
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,280
This isn't about the money.

317
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,180
I just want justice for my father.

318
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,680
Emily, there are a lot of people

319
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,190
who don't want this trial to proceed.

320
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,220
Dangerous people.

321
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,860
My mother died when I was a baby,

322
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,360
and my father has been the only family I've ever known

323
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,760
and they slit his throat.

324
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,700
They are going to have to kill me

325
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,380
if they want me to give this up.

326
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,420
Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.

327
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,060
And it won't.

328
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,430
What's going on?

329
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,500
What's going on is that the three of you

330
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,400
are getting around-the-clock police protection. Okay?

331
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,330
Get used to their faces,

332
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,560
because they're going with you everywhere you go, no arguments.

333
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,210
I'm a lawyer. I live to argue.

334
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,730
I'm your father. I live to keep you safe.

335
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,320
Um, Emily, let's go grab a cup of coffee, okay?

336
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,220
Yes, why not do that? Thank you. Please, go with them.

337
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,020
Stay there.

338
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,060
Protective custody?

339
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,930
I seem to recall you trying that once I discovered boys.

340
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,590
Didn't work then either.

341
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,630
This isn't a joke, Laurel.

342
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,100
Martin Somers got attacked last night.

343
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,000
- What?  - Yeah.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,710
- By who?  - It doesn't matter.

345
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,410
Point is, you have whipped up a storm with these guys,

346
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,550
and until the dust settles you'll be protected, okay?

347
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,330
End of discussion.

348
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,800
That might have worked when I was eight.

349
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,920
But it's not gonna work anymore.

350
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,260
End of discussion, Laurel!

351
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,030
You're insistent on doing your job, that's great.

352
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,350
But this is me doing mine, okay?

353
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,090
And not just as a father, but as a cop.

354
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,530
These people, they are more dangerous

355
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,730
than you are willing to admit.

356
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,830
And you've made them angry.

357
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,900
- Thank you for coming. - Anything for a friend.

358
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,500
We're not friends.

359
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,760
You smuggle drugs, I let you use my port.

360
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,560
For which you're paid a lot of money.

361
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,840
I don't get paid enough to have arrows shot at me.

362
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,060
You need to take this guy seriously.

363
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,670
He is a bigger threat to your operation than Nocenti ever was.

364
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,450
Except now it's Nocenti's daughter who's the problem.

365
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,030
Unlike your friend with the hood, we know where to find her.

366
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,080
Don't be an idiot.

367
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,230
You take out Emily Nocenti,

368
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,200
and Laurel Lance will never let this go.

369
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,950
She won't stop until she burns you,

370
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,110
me, and then the entire Triad to the ground.

371
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,980
Then we kill Miss Lance.

372
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,890
Attorney for shipping magnate, Martin Somers,

373
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,020
has confirmed his client has no intention of testifying

374
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,180
maintaining his innocence

375
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,070
in the wrongful death of Victor Nocenti.

376
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,950
Nocenti's body was found four weeks ago.

377
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,220
We'll keep you updated as more information becomes available.

378
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,160
Wait, how did you get those?

379
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,330
Don't you knock?

380
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,010
No, wait... Mom said that there were scars, but...

381
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,580
Oliver, what happened to you out there?

382
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,710
I don't want to talk about it.

383
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,650
Of course you don't.

384
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,320
You never want to talk to me about anything.

385
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,030
- Except for my social life.  - Wait!

386
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,060
Where are you going?

387
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,330
Why should I tell you?

388
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,680
I'm sorry, Thea.

389
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,590
I need to get better

390
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,060
at talking about what happened to me there.

391
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,360
But I'm not ready yet.

392
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,170
Okay?

393
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,260
Do you have a second?

394
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,300
Yeah.

395
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,780
Good.

396
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,680
I wanna show you something out back.

397
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,600
Sometimes, when I felt... Whatever...

398
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,020
I'd come here.

400
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,930
About a month after the funerals, Mom stopped going out.

401
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,290
Pretty soon, she stopped talking altogether.

402
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,590
The house got so quiet, so I'd come here.

403
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,830
To talk to you.

404
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,850
I mean, stupid stuff.

405
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,890
Like what I was doing that day, what boy I had a crush on...

406
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,120
And then sometimes, I'd ask you,

407
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,870
beg you, to find your way home to me.

408
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,890
Now, here you are.

409
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,690
And the truth is, I felt closer to you when you were dead.

410
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,440
Look, I know it was hell where you were.

411
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,410
But it was hell here too.

412
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,350
You gotta let me in, Ollie.

415
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,790
You gotta let someone in.

416
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,250
Hi.

417
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,470
Are you okay?

418
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,940
There are two cop cars outside.

419
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,590
How am I supposed to stay away from you

420
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,390
if you won't stay away from me?

421
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,550
- I... - What are you doing here, Ollie?

422
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
My sister took...

423
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,660
She pointed out to me that I

424
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,380
have been distant since I got back and that...

425
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,660
It would probably be a good idea if I let somebody in.

426
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,410
So, you thought you'd

427
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,540
start with the first person you pushed away.

428
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,970
I did that to protect you.

429
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,610
And then I saw you yesterday,

430
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,370
and I realized that I hurt you.

431
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,290
Thank you.

432
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,940
This place hasn't changed in five years.

433
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,460
I haven't really had time to redecorate.

434
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,220
I'm a jerk.

435
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,360
Before the island, I was a jerk,

436
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,650
and now I'm just a...

437
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,060
I'm a damaged jerk.

438
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,600
What's in the bag?

439
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,650
I thought about many things on the island,

440
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,070
but there was one thing that I thought about every day.

441
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,550
I actually dreamed about it,

442
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,830
and I promised myself that if I ever got a chance

443
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,360
to do it again, I'd do it with you.

444
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,610
Eat ice cream.

445
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,470
This is as good as I remember.

446
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,520
My mother wants me to join the company.

447
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,290
Yeah. Take my rightful place.

448
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,400
I can't exactly picture you as master of the Universe.

449
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,000
You know, after five years,

450
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,580
I have plans.

451
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,980
I have things that I have to do.

452
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,940
I can't do that if I'm...

453
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,590
I don't know...

454
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,810
Attending board meetings and stockholder briefings.

455
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,350
Oliver?

456
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,690
You're an adult.

457
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,930
You can say no.

458
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,100
Oh, I tried.

459
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,960
Didn't take.

460
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,150
Well, then don't tell her.

461
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,870
Show her.

462
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,820
Be the person that you want her to see you as.

463
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,480
Trust me.

464
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,450
I have plenty of experience with disapproving parents.

465
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,270
I have been on the receiving end of your father's disapproval.

466
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,260
He blames himself more than he blames you.

467
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,920
He thinks that, you know, maybe if he and Sarah were closer,

468
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,130
she would have told him about the boat trip.

469
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,860
And he could have stopped her from going with you.

470
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,290
I am sorry.

471
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,950
You apologized already.

472
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,510
And it'll never be enough.

473
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,980
Did you hear that?

474
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,390
What?

475
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,390
There's someone on the fire escape.

476
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,810
- What are...- Hey, come on..come on

477
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,140
- Are you hurt? - No.

478
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,510
Are you hurt, Mr. Queen?

479
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,200
No! No.

480
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,220
This is why it's a good idea to have a bodyguard.

481
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
You okay?

482
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
- Daddy! - Oh, thank God.

483
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,240
- Thank God. Are you all right? - I'm okay.

484
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,240
Those cops that you put on me...

485
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,900
- They... - I went outside to ask for a light

486
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,770
and they were both dead in the squad car.

487
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,580
Mr. Diggle, thank you.

488
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,790
Feel free to run as many red lights in the city as you want.

489
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,280
I was just doing my job, sir.

490
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,770
No, your job is protecting him.

491
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,630
It seems like whenever you're with one of my daughters, people die.

492
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,500
You stay away from Laurel,

493
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,380
or I swear the next time you disappear,

494
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
it will be permanent.

495
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,620
Dad!

496
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,170
No, Laurel...

497
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,640
It's okay, I understand.

498
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,690
Yeah.

499
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,250
I'd say thank you,

500
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,880
but I don't think that would cover it.

501
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,360
Well, like I told your cop friend,

502
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,200
I was just doing my job.

503
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,490
Besides, I think it should be you that I'm thanking.

504
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,330
- What for? - The knife.

505
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,450
The knife. I got lucky.

506
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,660
That was a kitchen knife.

507
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,900
It wasn't even weighted properly,

508
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,070
yet you threw it with accuracy across a 10-foot room.

509
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,190
Exactly. I got lucky.

510
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm not the kind of man you want to take for a fool,

511
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Mr. Queen, you understand me?

512
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,720
Yes.

513
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,380
And I think I'm just beginning

514
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,260
to understand the kind of man you are.

515
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,160
Shouldn't take you very long.

516
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,030
I'm shallow.

517
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,540
And very tired, so...

518
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,650
Good night.

519
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,600
Good night, sir.

520
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,380
I wanted to give Martin Somers the chance

521
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,940
to confess and face a court's justice,

522
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,320
but he chose to go after someone I care about instead.

523
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,750
He's still going to face justice.

524
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,440
It'll just be a different kind.

525
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,770
Triad bitch screwed up the hit on Lance.

526
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,720
Now, the Triad is gonna erase every ounce

527
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,410
of evidence of their smuggling operation, including me.

528
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,120
Except that's not gonna happen.

529
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,840
Tell Wallace to get the boat ready. I'm leaving tonight.

530
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,230
Wallace?

531
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,250
Wallace, you copy?

532
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Wallace?

533
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,510
Wallace isn't here.

534
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,610
But I am.

535
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,750
We need to move, now.

536
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,120
- Move! - Sir, we've got six men out there.

537
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,480
It's not enough. Move it!

538
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,890
You're gonna go back into that courtroom tomorrow

539
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,600
and you're gonna recuse yourself from this case, all right?

540
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,800
Or drop it. Either way, you're done.

541
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,990
If you think I'm gonna abandon Emily Nocenti,

542
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,400
then you don't know me all that well.

543
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,890
You don't know me well, young lady.

544
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,990
I will lock you in a cell if that's what it takes.

545
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,030
Well, I guess that's what it's gonna take then.

546
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,430
Damn it, Laurel!

547
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,410
I thought after what happened with Sarah,

548
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,230
you'd stop being just so reckless.

549
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,160
It's not about being reckless!

550
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,850
It's just the opposite.

551
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,540
I'm trying to make this city safer,

552
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,280
just like you.

553
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,890
Sweetie.

554
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,090
You're my only daughter, Laurel.

555
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,600
You're all I have left to live for.

556
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,640
But what you want from me isn't living.

557
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,420
Having cops around, not being able to do my job.

558
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,750
Your job is not going after people like the Triad or Somers.

559
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,600
My job is to use the law to fight for what is right.

560
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,380
Just like you taught me.

561
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,240
Well, that's dirty. Using me against me.

562
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,830
You can't do that.

563
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,510
Well,

564
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,890
maybe I picked that up along the way, too.

565
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,260
Lance.

566
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,740
I'll be right there.

567
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,960
I gotta go.

568
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,690
Something's going on at the docks.

569
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,330
Somers!

570
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,560
God, no, no, no.

571
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,840
He can't help you.

572
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,910
I want the truth about Victor Nocenti.

573
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,190
I can't.

574
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,380
The Triad will kill me.

575
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,220
The Triad's not your concern right now.

576
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,620
All right, all right, all right.

577
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,830
It wasn't me that killed him. It was the Triad.

578
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,550
Acting on whose instructions?

579
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,290
Whose?

580
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,970
All right, all right. It was mine. It was mine, all right?

581
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,380
Nocenti said he was gonna testify against me.

584
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,820
Police, drop your weapons, you are surrounded

585
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,820
Freeze!

586
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,670
You twitch and you're dead.

587
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,350
Bow down, hands up.

588
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,060
It was mine. It was mine, all right?

589
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,570
Nocenti said he was gonna testify against me.

590
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,850
You son of a bitch.

591
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,850
Laurel was right.

592
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,820
I can'be the Oliver my mother wants me to be

593
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,150
and still keep the promise I made to my father.

594
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,130
I have to be the person I need them to see me as.

595
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,690
Okay, this is a surprise.

596
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,120
Did you show up here by mistake?

597
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,890
By invitation.

598
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,020
- Oliver invited me last night. - Last night?

599
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,280
Is that surprise or jealousy I'm hearing?

600
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,550
Look, I just don't want him to find out anything, okay?

601
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,200
Oliver has been through a lot.

602
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,700
Tommy, we've all been through a lot.

603
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,290
Good afternoon.

604
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,280
And thank you all for coming.

605
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
Welcome to the future site of

606
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,230
the Robert Queen Memorial Applied Sciences Center.

607
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,660
Now, this is a building that will stand as a monument

608
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,690
to the man whose company and vision are his greatest legacies.

609
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,340
What about me? Right? I'm a legacy.

610
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,920
Hey! Thanks for warming them up, Walt.

611
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,840
All right. Ow! Fine, fine shovel. I got it.

612
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,540
WOMAN: He must be drunk.

613
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,240
OLIVER: I got it. I got it.

614
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,330
Some of you may not know me.

615
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,530
My name is Oliver Queen.

616
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,920
Watch some television, read a newspaper,

617
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,410
I'm kind of famous right now.

618
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,760
Mostly, though, I'm famous because I'm Robert Queen's son.

619
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,140
Uh, but as Walter, who's my new dad...

620
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,900
Huh? Who is... Sorry.

621
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,350
As Walter was saying,

622
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,420
I'm not much of a legacy, per se.

623
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,420
Oliver, you don't have to do this.

624
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,080
No, sit. Sit!

625
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,200
Gosh.

626
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,140
See, I was supposed to come here today,

627
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,180
and I'm supposed to take my rightful place at the company.

628
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,990
Prodigal son returns home and becomes the heir apparent.

629
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,330
But I'm not my father.

630
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,570
I'm not the man he was.

631
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,340
I'm not half the man he was.

632
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,370
I never will be.

633
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,340
So, please, stop asking me to be.

634
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,590
NEWSCASTER: Martin Somers, the CEO of Starling Port,

635
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,330
was arrested last night for the murder of Victor Nocenti.

636
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,020
He is also being accused of accepting cash,

637
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,140
including over $10 million in bribes.

638
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,060
Well, we can pursue the civil suit if you want,

639
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,830
but the D.A. now has no choice,

640
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,820
with Mr. Somers' confession, to prosecute him.

641
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,250
He's going to jail, Emily.

642
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,050
For the rest of his life.

643
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,240
Thank you so much for fighting for us.

644
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,400
Well, thank you for being brave enough to let me.

645
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,190
I thought I didn't need police protection anymore.

646
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,520
I thought I didn't need a reason to see my own daughter.

647
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,600
You don't.

648
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,170
Hmm. You look tired.

649
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,350
Yeah, I was filling out

650
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,550
reports on the shootout at the port last night

651
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,210
and getting grilled about how I let that archer get away.

652
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,260
I have to admit, I'm kind of glad he did.

653
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,650
He brought down Martin Somers.

654
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,090
He hurt a bunch of people doing it, okay?

655
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,090
He is no hero. He is an anarchist.

656
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
Yeah, well, whoever he is,

657
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,300
it seems like he's trying to help.

658
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,350
The city doesn't need that kind of help, okay?

659
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,660
It's like I always told you, you don't need to go

660
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,310
outside the law to find justice. Now I believe that.

661
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,640
All right? And I promise you, when I catch this guy,

662
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,160
he's gonna believe it, too.

663
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,160
Martin·Somers

664
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,160
Martin·Somers

665
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,900
Well, you saw for yourself.

666
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,360
My son knows nothing.

667
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,650
Robert didn't tell him anything that could hurt us.

668
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,110
And he has no idea that the yacht was sabotaged.

670
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,440
All that time on the island, plotting my return,

671
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,980
I didn't realize how hard it would be.

672
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,680
To reconnect with Mom, Thea,

673
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,070
Laurel. Okay, I didn't...

674
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,630
I didn't know how painful it would be to keep my secrets.

675
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,990
You asked me to save the city.

676
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,380
To right your wrongs.

677
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,220
I will.

678
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,220
I swear.

679
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,940
But to do that,

680
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,530
I can't be the Oliver that everyone wants me to be,

681
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,940
which means that sometimes...

682
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,720
To honor your wishes...

683
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,660
I need to dishonor your memory.

684
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,640
I'm sorry.

685
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,820
Take it down.

686
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,020
Will you be going out tonight, sir?

687
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,940
Definitely.

688
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,250
No, no...
